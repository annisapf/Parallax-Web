# Parallax-Website
This is a *Responsive Portfolio* only contains 1 single page scrollable, made in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## Goal
Bootstrap helps a developer to build a responsive website since Bootstrap has one of the best responsive, mobile-first grid systems available. Bootstrap built with Flexbox and very easy to use. As a developer, we can easily scale a single website design from the smallest mobile device to high-definition displays (in this particular case from 400px - 768px - 900px).

In addition, building a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap as a website developer is helpful in showcasing our skills and experiences specially if we are actively looking for a new opportunity. The portfolio is showing our unique style and a collection of projects or past works that would (hopefully) lead to a job offer.
